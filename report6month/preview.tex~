\subsection{The TCC Automation}
\vskip 0.5cm
{\bf Introduction :}\\\\
The Software running today does all the entry and management of the Jobs, all done by Consultancy employees. The existing system manage the generation of Bill, Recipts and Vouchers very efficiently.\\\\
Testing \& Consultancy Cell is a Department in our college that provide testing and Consultancy services to different clients. This cell does a lot of work like managing the clients, handling there work till completion. This work also requires managing a lot of paper work. Thus TCC Automation Software comes into the use. \\ \\
{\bf Features of the Software that is to be built}
\begin{itemize}
\item Open Source
\item User Interative Software
\item Online
\item Dynamic
\item Proper User and Admin interface
\item Catalog
\item Distance Calculation through map
\item Efficient Search module
\item Universal (Can be changed according to application/work)
\item Report generation
\item Single click installation
\item Proper User and develpor documentation
\end{itemize}

{\bf Limitations of Current System :}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently, there is no central environment where the clients can register themselves online and order for a Job or can get information from and manage their own tasks. The existing system involves the employers of Consultacy Cell managing information by interacting directly with the clients about there Jobs.
\item Moreover, there is a need for a Search module that searches the previously registered Client, so that redundancy can be reduced to the maximum. 
\item Also the current Software requires the proper Normlisation of Database.
\item Apart from all these there is a need to make the calculation of total amount of Job done to be automated by Software itself. The current system requires the manual calculation. 
\item There is also a need of proper Developer Documentation.  
\item There should be a single click installation procedure for the Software.
\item Reports are not generated in the Software.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Functions Provided in Proposed system}
\vskip 0.5cm
\begin{description}
\item[Registeration \& Login] :\\
The software user would be required to Register through a screen. After authentication and login he would be able to access only those areas for which he is capable to access.
\item[Administrator Maintenance] :\\
Administrator can add or update the details, and also can see information of all employees and can see his or her information. New Database table information can also be added.
\item[Employee Maintenance] :\\
As employees are directly related to clients, so they are able to add or update the details of clients using this section. Admin can see all the clients. Employees can manage their clients only.
\item[Client Maintenance] :\\
Clients are the end users that benefit from the TCC Automation Software. A client can get information of all the available work done in Testing & Consultancy Cell also apply for same. They can also view the status of there previous works done in the Cell.
\item[Catalog] :\\
Using the Catalog, the clients can get an estimate of price for all the tests done in the Cell. Catalog lists down all the works done in the Cell.
\item[Cart] :\\
Using this functionality, a client can test multiple materials in a single Job, thus getting only one Receipt and Bill for a Job.
\item[Report Generation] :\\
The Report generation for a material tested is made easier now. The reports generated can then be downloaded in pdf format and then can be given to the repective clients.

\subsection{Modules of the Software}
\begin{description}
\item[1. Installation] : Installation of the Software and that too smoothly is the most important step for making the software run. The installation module is made, keeping in mind the different platforms or the versions of the system. The installation procedure is made very easy, informing the users about all the changes that are to be made in his/her system.
\item[2. Registration] : This involves user authentication, login, user Registration as a client. There are different views of the software that vaies on the user using it. That means user is able to see only that part to which he/she is authenticated.
\item[3. Catalog] : Catalog provides all the information about the product, there rate, quantity etc. Seeing the catalog list user can get an estimate of the total amount he would spend on entering a Job or work.
\item[4. Job Entry] : Job entry module involves entering the Job or work that need to be done in a particular lab or a site. This also involves getting the distance between the organisation and site. The client can add both Lab and Field works. Multiple works can be done in a single Job. 
\item[5. Amount Calculation] : Depending on the type of work to be done, material tested and number of tests to be performed the amount the automatically calculated by the Software. Then on the calculated amount the divisions are done and then taxes are applied.
\item[6. Search] : The search module include searching a client or Job that has previously been added. After getting the results of the search, the operations like getting the previous work done by the client, status of those works or further adding new works are performed. 
\item[7. Bill, Receipt \& Voucher Generation] : In this module after all the calculations done and data saved, the Bill, Receipt and the Voucher for the Job is generated that then is to be returned to the client.
\item[8. Registers Generation] : This module involves retrieving all the previous entries that were performed. These registeres include : Daily Report, Monthly Register, Main Register, Suspence Clearance Register, Lab Report, Client Report etc.
\item[9. CashBook] : CashBook module involve managing all the money transactions.  The involves all the cash debited or credited and the transactions made on them.
